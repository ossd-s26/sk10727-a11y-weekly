Some information about you!

### More Information

Hi! My name is Sahiti and I am a junior at NYU studying Finance and Computer Science. I am using this blog to track my development and learning in CSCI-UA 480, Open Source Software Development. In my free time, I like to take long walks in Central Park, binge-watch TV shows, and experiment with new recipes.
