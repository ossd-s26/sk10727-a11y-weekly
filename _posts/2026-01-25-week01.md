title: Week 1: My Experience with Open Source
---

"Open source" to me means making source code accessible, leading to community, collaboration, and collective improvement. Considering I've been using Wikipedia for as long as I can remember, I feel strongly about the benefits of open source development, though the actual intricacies of it are a mystery to me, and something I hope to learn through this class. Additionally, as a finance student, I'd love to learn more about how open source development is analyzed from a financial perspective. When do companies choose to use an open source business model and what are the different routes they can take?

Until writing this list I had never realized that I used so many open source projects. Here are a few of my favorites:
 - VSCode: My favorite IDE since high school (to be fair, I used jGRASP before, so pretty easy to beat)
 - Wikimedia: As aforementioned, I've been using Wikipedia for as long as I can remember. While I've advanced past blindly trusting facts from Wikipedia, I now use it (and Fandom) to read plot summaries for TV show episodes when I'm too impatient to keep watching to find out what happens
 - Pandas Data Reader: Used to access macroeconomic data from FRED and Fama-French industry portfolio returns for my final project in Data-Driven Investing with Python. We used the data from Pandas Data Reader to predict how industry-level factor exposures change across different macroeconomic environments.
 - GitHub: For version control and collaboration. Not the most familiar since I mainly started using last semester as a part of Operating Systems!
